# 🧠 .dotconfig

My personal system configuration files — tuned for productivity, performance, and a clean development environment.

## 🧩 Includes
- **Zsh** configuration with aliases, plugins, and fzf integration   
- **Git** config for clean commits and diffs  
- **fzf** setup for efficient terminal workflows  
- Other system tweaks and shell scripts I use daily  

## ⚙️ Setup

Clone the repo and symlink the configs to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerdlyDev/.dotconfig ~/.dotconfig
cd ~/.dotconfig
./install.sh   # if you have a setup script
